### About

#### Beginning

The initial idea for FindYourDuo was developed during the event offered by [@RocketSeat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/), so all the design and idea came from the organizers of the NLW eSports and professionals who collaborated on the event.

#### Post-event

After the event, I decided to continue the project by adding some tools such as NextJS, Redux, MongoDB, integration with TwitchAPI and IGDB Api, among several other tasks that were not covered in the course for both the Frontend and Backend of the application.

### Project Status

In development, any contribution will be welcome :)
